# Code basics

One place for me as a beginner Web Developer to gather all basic coding principles, code challenges etc. everything needed to remember or to train.

## Motivation

In this special field of knowledge there is no single place of truth. The sources are scattered in various places, on many media. I want to have a place to come back, in need to get to the coding basics.

## Tech used

Build with:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Table of contents

1. JavaScript basic principles, rules and conventions - inspired by [Coders Lab](https://coderslab.pl/)
2. Useful code snippets (snippet tests) - IN FUTURE
3. RegEx - IN FUTURE
4. Codi test - IN FUTURE
5. and hopefully much more

## Contribute

Feel free to add any piece of code which you think is worth knowing, or practicing in the broad fiels of *Web Development*
