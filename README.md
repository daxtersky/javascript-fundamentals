# Code basics

One place for me as a developing Web Developer to gather all basic coding principles, code challenges etc. everything needed to remember or to train.

## Motivation

In this special field of knowledge there is no single place of truth. The sources are scattered in various places, on many media. I want to have a place to come back, in need to get to the coding basics.

## Tech used

Build with:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* TypeScript

## How to run ts files (Linux / MacOS)
`tsc main.ts | node main.js`
